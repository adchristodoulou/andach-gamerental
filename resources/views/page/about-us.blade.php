	<h2>About Us</h2>
	<p>Andach Game Rental is a simple subscription service for anyone who wants to rent video games. You can get as many as you want each month, in a completely automated service.</p>
	<p>We started in 2017 with a view to creating a completely open-source service to build on the trust of our users. You can be sure that all your data is safe with us, because our code is completely released on github for anyone to view.</p>
	<p>We're also committed to openness in our business activities as well. We'll publish our details of which games are most popular, how many other people have games on their lists and how many games we have in stock. We've got nothing to hide at all. </p>
